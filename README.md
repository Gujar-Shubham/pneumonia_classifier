# Image classification with Keras and Flask deployed on Heroku

This repo shows how to deploy an image classification model using Tensorflow Keras 
and Flask on Heroku. The model I use is MobileNetV2 since it is the smallest model in 
terms of number of parameters and size. Given an input image, the model classifies it 
into one of the thousand categories in ImageNet. The model is deployed in 
[this](https://image-classification-keras.herokuapp.com/) link.

The accompanying blog post is accessible [here](https://bashirkazimi.github.io/post/0005-deploying-deeplearning-model-to-heroku/).
